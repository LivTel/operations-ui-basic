>>ListenerRegistrationPage

This page shows a timeline of each handler for any sort of callback update. Any Handler which registers as
a listener should also in addition to its Listener interface implement the CallbackRegistration iface.

This allows it to be added to the queue of handlers to enable a primary thread to handle all its registrations.

CallbackRegistration.registerWithProvider(): Informs the handler to register with its provider.
  
The registration thread maintains a list of CBRegs and update timings, it calls the above method for
each handler at the required timings.

When the registration succeeds, a connected StateTimeLine is updated appropriately.

There may need to be a JSPane to allow the number of listeners to be shown - this is likely to be more of
an engineering page under Engineering tab?
