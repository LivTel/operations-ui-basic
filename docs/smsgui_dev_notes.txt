some stuff for the sms gui


various tabs:

1. current sweep - what metrics etc for each group and how ranked

2. historic sweeps - what won and score and metrics.

3. prescan - lookahead for whole night feasibility display

4. LAS - current sequence

graph areas:

predicted score as fn of time
actual score as night progresses - eg penalty effect of following LAS sequence and conditions deteriorate

LAS parameters and metrics:
- current horizon, time elapse, time-to-go
- various trigger, threshold and cut-off param values
- values of various quantities monitored for adaptation purposes  
   - actual v predicted exec times
   - exec/actual
   - stability params
   - volatility params (various rho and omega values, deltacc, deltacd etc)
- values of adaptive functions like q(t)

- graphs of various metrics of running groups thro night

5. Tracking list.
- A list of groups we want to watch thro the night.
	For each group we have a detail panel showing:-
	- on which sweeps does it not get considered
	- on which sweeps does it get scored (but not selected)
	- when does it get selected
	
	- Thse could be plotted on some kind of score type graph thro night.
