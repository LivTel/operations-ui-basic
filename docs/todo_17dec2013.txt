some stuff to do wrt opsgui and telemetry feeds:

telemetry services:
-------------------

rcs-operations feed
 needs to provide MCA changes as well as integrate the GOM which though
  its a feed, is not compliant feed.


sms-smp feed:
  - we want the existing p2 update events to become compliant (status interface)  
  - smp must forward its updates to external listeners ie
  - SynopticModelArchiveGateway impl Phase2UpdateListener, AccountUpdateListener, HistUpdateListener
  

opsgui:
-------

phase2-perspective:

 - link smp gateway events to allow update
   - 




tracking-perspective:

 - aitoff
   - target list concept
     (list of targets - name, desc, id)  
      target list rendererpanel 
      - symbol type, color, italic/plain
   
   - select which target lists are displayed - key on sidebar of aitoff 
     (symbol/color/font/id, desc as tooltip)
   
   - astrometry catalog provider 
     - listCatalogs() ; list of catalogs with idents.


   - push stuff onto aitoff from scheduler/ops feeds - this group starting, done now.

 - menus
   - overlay menu
     - on/off for history or hist 1h, 2h, 4h etc
     - maybe history age coloring ?
     - each targetlist - on/off


   - targetlist menu
    - load targetlist - from file or via astroprovider
      when add tlist
       -add a tlist menu to the menu
       -add key element to legend (targetlistrendererpanel)
