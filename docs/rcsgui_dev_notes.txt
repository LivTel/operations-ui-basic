some things wanted in the rcsgui.

some stuff should always be visible. (mainly these are things already being done in original rcsgui)

	-rcs state variables - these show how the rcs is thinking (wrt its state model)
	-current state (ie the current statemodel state)
	-operating mode/agent in control
	-transitional operations (open/close/start/etc)
	-instrument summary (state of each instrument offline/ok/warn and maybe temperature) - link to inst panel
	-current sky conditions - link takes direct to sky panel
	-scheduler and lower model states
	
new stuff in the always visible category

	-mech summary (what are the axes doing az=track, alt=track, rot=slew etc)
	-current observation (summary ie ids)- link takes direct to full observation panel
	
displays - these are category-specific items
	
	-mech 
	-meteo (various additional external sensors like cloud), dust data would be good also (from tng)
	-sec mech
	
	
graphs - these are sets of graphs under a category
	
	-mech
	-meteo
	
Envisage a tab per category the show 1 or 2 value tabs and a tab with all the graphs subordinate to it

Instruments

	-tab per instrument and status display subtab, multigraph subtab
	
	
Instrument health panel - shows time display of instrument state for all instruments

Summary graphs - ie thumbnails (9/16 per tab page)- maybe allow user to select graphs to put onto thumbnails
and allow them to shift the positions around.

Useful to be able to see longer periods rather than just 1 hour or whatever its set to.
	
Some things which are not really operations but more robotics - ie analyzing the behaviour of the rcs.
	
	-display the state of the various weather (and other) rules - ie have they triggered, are they
	 in a 50% of the way to ok state ?....this could be in a colorized timeline format
	-show seeing histogram as it builds up - maybe distinguish stds and others...
	-agent information - expandable - ie each agent has specific info in it.
	-task analyzer - show tree of current tasks - events signaled back when task completes, initd, new tasks
	created under it, etc.
	-task parallelism - show waterfall plot of what each active (executive) task is doing, not mgrs.
